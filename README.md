## Visual Studio 2017 Installation

The Python development workload is available as part of the [preview version of Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.com/vs/preview?wt.mc_id=github_microsoft_ptvs). This installs side-by-side with the regular install of Visual Studio 2017 and includes all features from the stable release as well as early previews of new functionality. See [our blog post](http://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2017/03/07/python-support-in-vs2017/) for more details.

## Visual Studio 2015 and earlier

Prior to Visual Studio 2017, Python support was released as a standalone extension. We are no longer actively developing these versions, but if you are unable to upgrade to Visual Studio 2017 yet, you can use these older installers to get Python support.

[PTVS 2.2.6](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/releases/v2.2.6) is the latest available version for Visual Studio 2015. You can also find it in the Visual Studio 2015 installer by selecting "Custom" and looking under the "Programming Languages" category.

[PTVS 2.2.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/releases/v2.2.2) is the last release for Visual Studio 2013 users.

[PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707) is still available from CodePlex for users on Visual Studio 2012 and 2010.


Thank you for using and supporting Python Tools for Visual Studio.
